# Express demo application

In order to run this application using the terminal:

- Run the command `npm run build` to build the application.
- Run the command `npm run start` to start the server.
- Run the command `npm run dev` to run the server in listen mode (meaning each time a file change occurs, the server will be rebuild automatically)
- If you are using the visual studio code, you can debug this application by running the debugger (press F5)
