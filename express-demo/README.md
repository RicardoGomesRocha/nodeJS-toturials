# Express demo application

Small application to explore how to create a nodeJS and express server application.

You can find more information about this tutorial in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48). Also, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRo2tvQpus8) you can find more info how I configure this project in order to use typescript instead of pure javascript.

## How to run the application

In order to run this application using the terminal:

- Run the command `npm run build` to build the application.
- Run the command `npm run start` to start the server.
- Run the command `npm run dev` to run the server in listen mode (meaning each time a file change occurs, the server will be rebuild automatically)
- If you are using the visual studio code, you can debug this application by running the debugger (press F5)

## How to test the application

You can test the application by importing the `postman.json` and `postman.env.json` to the postman. The collection imported has an example of all api which this application supports.
